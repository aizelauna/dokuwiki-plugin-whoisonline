whoisonline Plugin for DokuWiki

Tracks who is online and what part of wiki they are on.
Got the idea and some code/styling from nice article at
http://tutorialzine.com/2010/03/who-is-online-widget-php-mysql-jquery/

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
http://www.csus.edu

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/whoisonline/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
